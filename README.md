## Getting Started

1. Use this template to generate a new repository or fork this repository.
2. For local development, clone the repository, run `pnpm install` to install dependencies, and `pnpm dev` to start the development server.

   - If [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is not installed, first run `npm install -g pnpm` to install it.

3. Customize your blog through the configuration file `src/config.ts`. Configuration documentation can be found in the comments of `src/types/config.ts`.
4. Run `pnpm new [draft|post] [title]` to create a new article. If creating a draft, run `pnpm pub` to publish it to the `src/content/posts` directory when finished.
5. Refer to the [official guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to deploy your blog to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc. Before deployment, edit the site settings in astro.config.mjs.
